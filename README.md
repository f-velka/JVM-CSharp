# JVM-CSharp

WIP

Test JVM implementation using C# for studying, inspired by [this](https://speakerdeck.com/memory1994/php-de-jvm-woshi-zhuang-site-hello-world-wochu-li-surumade).

The program is based on [The Java8 jvm specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/index.html), but does not follow the specification at all.
